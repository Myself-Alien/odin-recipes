                    Shrimp Biryani is a delectable and aromatic dish that combines the succulent flavors of shrimp with
                    fragrant basmati rice and a blend of spices. This dish is a popular variation of the traditional
                    biryani, a classic Indian rice dish known for its rich and complex flavors.

                    such as turmeric, cumin, coriander, and garam masala. The marinated shrimp is then cooked with

                    Meanwhile, basmati rice is parboiled and layered with the cooked shrimp masala in a large pot. The
                    layers are then steamed together to allow the flavors to meld and the rice to absorb the aromatic
                    spices, resulting in a flavorful and fragrant one-pot meal.

                    Shrimp Biryani is often garnished with fried onions, fresh cilantro, and mint leaves to add a burst
                    of freshness and texture. This dish is typically served with raita (yogurt sauce), pickle, and
                    papadum, making it a complete and satisfying meal that is perfect for special occasions or
